# git-work

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](https://github.com/mdbs99/git-work/blob/master/README.md)

A collection of Git minimalist extensions to provide high-level repository operations.

It is clean, easy to understand, simple to make changes, and flexible. It is an alternative to [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow).

## Installing

`git-work` will be "installed" as an *alias* to `git`.

First, fork this repository. 
Then, you just need to run the command below in your `git` prompt:

`git config --global alias.work '!sh "/path/git-work.sh" '`

Pay attention to set the correct `path`, which should be the same where you've cloned this repository.

Finally, type `git work` to see a minimal help.
